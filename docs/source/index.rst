=====================

**bayesgm** is a toolkit providing a AI-driven Bayesian generative modeling framework for various Bayesian inference tasks in complex, high-dimensional data.

The framework is built upon Bayesian principles combined with modern AI models, enabling flexible modeling of complex dependencies with principled uncertainty estimation.

Currently, the **bayesgm** package includes two model families:

- **BGM**: Bayesian generative modeling for arbitrary conditional inference (foundational model).
- **CausalBGM**: Bayesian generative modeling for causal effect estimation.
